### README

* These scripts are intended to automate the OpenVPN installation process using Private Internet Access (PIA) as the VPN provider:
* Install OpenVPN
* Download/apply PIA config files
* Setup PIA DNS servers (to prevent ISP DNS leaks)
* Install VPNKillSwitch service

### TODO

* Scripts still need heavy debugging and error-checking.
* At this point I don't recommend the script. Check the wiki for manual instructions.
