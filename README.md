## Shell Scripts for Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)

### Various scripts to install/configure software for Raspberry Pi.

For example, install and configure OpenVPN client with Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN, including DNS leak protection, kill switch, and auto-reconnect.

I created these scripts for my own personal use. Please use at your own risk.

The Wiki will provide better instruction.
